# twitter-form-design
This project features a Twitter Form Design inspired by the Twitter platform's sleek and modern UI/UX.
This project is purely a practice work to improve my proficiency in HTML and internal CSS. The main goal was to replicate a familiar UI and implement internal styling techniques.
